<h1>How to Play</h1>
<p>
    Invasive Impostor is a social deduction game for 4-10 players who each have a phone capable of sending and receiving SMS text messages.
    Players make decisions in this game by responding to text messages on their phones.
    The players should all be positioned so that they can read the webpage but cannot read other players' phones.
</p>
<p>
    One of the players is an invasive species, while the other players are native species.
    This information is texted to players at the beginning of the game and should be kept secret.
    The invasive species player wins when there is only one native species player remaining.
    The native species players win when either the invasive species player is voted out or a combined total of food equal to three times the number of players in the game is consumed by all the native species players combined.

    The game takes place in rounds.
    In the first phase of each round, players will eat food.
    To start the round, there will be a random amount, between half the total number of players and twice the total number of players, of food in the pile.
    In the order indicated on the webpage, each player will be told how much food is remaining in the pile, then asked how much food they will take.
    Native species players may take 1 or 2 food at a time.
    The invasive species player may take any amount of food (even 0).
    The first native species player to arrive at a pile that has no food left has starved and is out of the game.

<p>
    In the second phase of each round, the remaining players can talk to each other and then vote for who they think is the invasive species player.
    The player with the most votes is out of the game unless there is more than one player tied for the most votes, in which case no one is eliminated.
    After the voting has concluded, the next round begins with a new food pile.
    The rounds continue in this cycle until the game has a winner.
