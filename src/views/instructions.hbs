<h1>How to Play</h1>
<p>Invasive Impostor is a social deduction game for 4-10 players who each have a phone capable of sending and receiving SMS text messages.</p>
<p>Players make decisions in this game by responding to text messages on their phones.</p>
<p>The players should all be positioned so that they can read the webpage but cannot read other players' phones.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the players is an invasive species, while the other players are native species.</p>
<p>This information is texted to players at the beginning of the game and should be kept secret.</p>
<p>The invasive species player wins when there is only one native species player remaining.</p>
<p>The native species players win when either the invasive species player is voted out or a combined total of resources equal to four times the number of players in the game has been consumed by all the native species players combined.</p>
<hr>
<p>The game takes place in rounds.</p>
<p>In the first phase of each round, players will gather and consume resources.</p>
<p>To start the round, there will be a random amount, between half the total number of players and twice the total number of players, of resources in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the order indicated on the webpage, each player will be told how many resources remain, then asked how much they will take.</p>
<p>Native species players may take 1 or 2 resources when it is their turn.</p>
<p>The invasive species player may take any amount of resources (even 0) on their turn.</p>
<p>The first native species player to arrive at a pile that has no resources left has gone extinct and is out of the game.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the second phase of each round, the remaining players can talk to each other and then vote for who they think is the invasive species player.</p>
<p>The player with the most votes is out of the game unless there is more than one player tied for the most votes, in which case no one is eliminated.</p>
<p>After the voting has concluded, the next round begins with a new quantity of resources in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The rounds continue in this cycle until the game has a winner.</p>
